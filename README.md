# fitnessCenterChatBot

Chatbots are computer programs that conduct conversations and are often designed to convincingly simulate the way humans behave as conversation partners. The **fitness center chatbot** is dedicated to using the NLTK feature to identify key words and help customers with simple authentication, registration information and sending a "successful registration" confirmation message, access to help information and booking services. In addition to professional customer service, the chatbot can answer daily greetings and non-professional questions about the weather or local times.
